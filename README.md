Given the dimensions of a few boxes, finds the dimensions of the best way to orient each box so that the box surrounding all of them would have the least surface area. Uses a brute force method to solve and displays the result using JavaFX. 

Input boxes are changed by changing the program itself, didn't have time to make an input :)
